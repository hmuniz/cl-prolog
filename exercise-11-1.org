The representation of relations has been a list whose first element is a symbol. However, for
relations with no arguments, some people prefer to write (<- p q r) rather than (<- (p) (q) (r))

Code: 
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(in-package #:cl-prolog)

(defmacro <- (&rest clause)
  `(if (consp (car ',clause))
      (add-clause ',clause))
      (add-clause (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (list x)) ',clause)))

#+END_SRC
