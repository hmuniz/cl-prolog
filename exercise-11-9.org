  Write Prolog rules to express the terms father, mother, son, daughter,
and grand- versions of each of them. Also define parent, child, wife,
husband, brother, sister, uncle, and aunt. You will need to decide 
which relations are primitive (stored in the Prolog data base) and
which are derived by rules.

  For example, here's a definition of grandfather that says that G is 
the grandfather of C if G is the father of some P, who is the parent of C:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(<- (grandfather ?g ?c) 
    (father ?g ?p)
    (parent ?p ?c))
#+END_SRC


Ansewr: 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(<- (father ?f ?c) (male ?f) (parent ?f ?c))
(<- (mother ?m ?c) (female ?m) (parent ?m ?c))  
(<- (son ?s ?p) (male ?f) (parent ?f ?c))
(<- (daughter ?s ?p) (male ?s) (parent ?p ?s))


(<- (grandfather ?g ?c) (father ?g ?p) (parent ?p ?c))
(<- (grandmother ?g ?c) (mother ?g ?p) (parent ?p ?c))
(<- (grandson ?gs ?gp) (son ?gs ?p) (parent ?gp ?p))
(<- (granddaughter ?gd ?gp) (daughter ?gd ?p) (parent ?gp ?p))


(<- (parent ?p ?c) (child ?c ?p))
(<- (wife ?w ?h) (married ?h ?w))
(<- (husband ?h ?w) (married ?h ?w))

(<- (sibling ?x ?y) (parent ?p ?x) (parent ?p ?y))
(<- (brother ?b ?x) (male ?b) (sibling ?b ?XI)
(<- (sister ?s ?x) (female ?s) (sibling ?s ?XI)
(<- (uncle ?u ?n) (brother ?u ?p) (parent ?p ?n))
(<- (aunt ?a ?n) (sister ?a ?p) (parent ?p ?n))
#+END_SRC
