The following problem is presented in Wirth1976:

   I married a widow (let's call her W )who has a grown-up daughter (call her D).
   My father (F), who visited us often, fell in love with my step-daughter and
   married her. Hence my father became my son-in-law and my step-daughter became 
   my mother. Some months later, my wife gave birth to a son (S1),who became the
   brother-in-law of my father, as well as my uncle. The wife of my father, that is,
   my step-daughter, also had a son (S2).

Represent this situation using the predicates defined in the previous exercise,verify
 its conclusions, and prove that the narrator of this tale is his own grandfather.
