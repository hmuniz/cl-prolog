#+Title: Exercise 11-9
#+Date: <2017-07-13 Thu>

The following problem is presented in Wirth1976:

   I married a widow (let's call her W )who has a grown-up daughter (call her D).
   My father (F), who visited us often, fell in love with my step-daughter and
   married her. Hence my father became my son-in-law and my step-daughter became 
   my mother. Some months later, my wife gave birth to a son (S1),who became the
   brother-in-law of my father, as well as my uncle. The wife of my father, that is,
   my step-daughter, also had a son (S2).

Represent this situation using the predicates defined in the previous exercise,verify
 its conclusions, and prove that the narrator of this tale is his own grandfather.
 
Code: 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(<- (parent ?p ?c) (married ?p ?w) (child ?c ?w)) 
(<- (parent ?p ?c) (married ?h ?p) (child ?c ?w)) 
(<- (son-in-law ?s ?p) (parent ?p ?w) (married ?s ?w))


(<- (male I))
(<- (male F))
(<- (male S1))
(<- (male S2)) 
(c- (female W))
(<- (female D))
(<- (married I W))
(<- (married F D))
(<- (child D W)) 
(<- (child I F)) 
(<- (child S1 I)) 
(<- (child S2 F))
